# Alphabetizer
This Python program can take any .txt file as input and sort all of the words in the file alphabetically. 
This is done by splitting the file at either a new line or a specific set of characters (pattern) input by the user.
Once the alphabetizing process is complete, the user can either rewrite the existing file, or create a new one with the alphabetized words.
